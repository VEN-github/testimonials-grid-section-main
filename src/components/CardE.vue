      “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
      professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
      former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
      curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
      for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
      the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
      during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
      as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
