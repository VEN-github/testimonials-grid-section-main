      I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in
      the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

      “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
      free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
      weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
      successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”
