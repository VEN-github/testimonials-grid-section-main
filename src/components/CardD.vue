      “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
      program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself
      as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
      attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”
